Zen of Python
1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2.
3.
4.Complex is better than complicated.
5.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. Readability counts.
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9. Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
20. Оскільки ZEN закінчився, а я залишився, то додам вам котика :)
